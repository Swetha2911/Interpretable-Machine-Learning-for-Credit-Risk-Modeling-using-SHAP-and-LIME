
GLOBAL FINDINGS (SHAP):
- DTI, revolving utilization, & delinquencies increase default risk.
- High income and long credit history reduce default risk.

LOCAL FINDINGS (SHAP & LIME):
- Both methods consistently identify DTI & utilization as top contributors.
- LIME is easier to interpret locally; SHAP is more consistent globally.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid approving loans with DTI > 45%.
2. Flag customers with 2+ delinquencies for manual review.
3. Encourage utilization < 60%.
4. Prefer customers with long credit histories.
5. Use income stability as a compensating factor.
